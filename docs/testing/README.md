# Aaraksha — Testing Documentation

Index for the final system-wide QA, integration, security, and UX validation pass ahead of the
SIH screening round. Full plan: [`QA-MASTER-PLAN.md`](./QA-MASTER-PLAN.md).

**Rule this index exists to enforce:** everything actively being tested lives here, in
`docs/testing/`. General research and strategy docs live in `docs/Research/`. Current portal
screenshots live in `docs/screenshots/`. Don't mix the three.
